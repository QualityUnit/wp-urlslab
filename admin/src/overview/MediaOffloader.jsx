					<h4>About the module</h4>
					<p>The Media Manager module can be a great tool for improving the performance of any website. With its automatic image enhancement, it can make images smaller while also offloading them to the cloud or a database. This will help reduce the load time when a user accesses a website. In addition to this, it can also generate modern image formats such as WebP and Avif, which are more efficient and provide better compression ratios.</p>
					<p>Moreover, it can also help with SEO by automatically removing broken images from the content, thus improving the overall experience for the users. It can be a great way to ensure your website is optimised and running at its best.</p>
