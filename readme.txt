Elevate your WordPress site with URLsLab - boost SEO and performance with minimal effort.

== Description ==

**The plugin is in the BETA.**

Introducing URLsLab, a powerful and versatile WordPress plugin designed to optimize your website's performance and SEO. With a suite of innovative modules, URLsLab automates various tasks and improvements, ensuring your website stands out in the digital landscape.

URLsLab's Automated Screenshots module enhances the visual appeal of your content by generating screenshots automatically. This, combined with the Related Articles module, strengthens your onsite SEO and internal link structure by creating content clusters, making it easier for search engines to understand and rank your website.

Take control of your internal and external links with the Links Manager module, while the Keywords Manager boosts your internal link building, ensuring your content ranks higher in search results. The Image SEO module automatically adds descriptive alt texts to your website's images, further improving your site's search engine optimization.

Maximize your content's shareability with the Meta Tags Manager, allowing you to add custom meta tags for improved visibility on social media platforms. Enhance your website's performance with the Media Manager, which offers automatic image enhancement and offloading to the cloud or a database. Optimize page loading times with the Lazy Loading module, which defers loading of large content chunks, images, videos, and iframes.

URLsLab doesn't stop there – with the CSS Optimizer, inline CSS is used to improve page performance and reduce content-blocker requests. Keep your website running smoothly with the Database Optimizer, which automates database optimization in the background. Finally, the Search and Replace module offers powerful tools to automatically correct incorrect URLs and content on the fly.

Unlock your website's full potential with URLsLab – the ultimate WordPress plugin for boosting performance and SEO with minimal effort.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How can I update the WordPress plugin?**

To update your WordPress plugin, navigate to your WordPress dashboard and click on "Plugins" in the left-hand menu. If an update is available, you will see a notification under the plugin name. Click on the "Update Now" link and the plugin will automatically update to the latest version. Make sure to backup your website before updating plugins to avoid any potential issues.

**How can I report a bug in the plugin?**

To report a bug in the plugin, you can [create a new issue in the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/QualityUnit/wp-urlslab/issues). Provide as much information as possible about the issue you're experiencing, including the plugin version, WordPress version, and any error messages you've encountered. This will help the developer diagnose and fix the issue more quickly.

**Where can I request a new feature for the plugin?**

To request a new feature for the plugin, you can [submit a new issue in the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/QualityUnit/wp-urlslab/issues), detailing the feature you'd like to see implemented and why you believe it would be beneficial to the plugin's functionality. The plugin developers will review your request and determine if it's something they can add to their development roadmap.

**Will the plugin work with my WordPress theme?**

Most WordPress plugins are designed to work with any theme. However, compatibility issues can sometimes occur due to differences in coding and design. To ensure the plugin works with your theme, check the plugin's documentation for any known compatibility issues. If you're unsure, you can also reach out to the plugin developer or your theme's support team for guidance.

**My site is broken after activating or updating the plugin. What should I do?**

If your website breaks after activating or updating a plugin, first deactivate the plugin to see if it resolves the issue. If your site is still broken, you may need to restore a backup of your website from before the plugin was activated or updated. Once you've restored your site, contact the plugin developer and provide details about the issue so they can investigate and resolve the problem. In the meantime, you may want to look for an alternative plugin with similar functionality.
